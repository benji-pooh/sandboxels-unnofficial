 Some info that i have found and may be useful:

 `all_liquids.js` appears to be broken, as well as some others. I reccomend disabling any mods that throw errors in the Dev Console.
 
 I may try to edit and fix some mods since quite a lot of them are broken, and are dependent on other broken mods. Feel free to contribute if you would like to help! :)
