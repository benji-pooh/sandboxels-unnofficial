To add the array to the local storage:

Go to developer panel(`CTRL+SHIFT+I` or `COMMAND+OPTION+I`), then go to application tab. Then, copy the array data then inject it into the **`enabledMods`** key field. Reload and ~11k elements should be present. This should work assuming that you are using the newer version and have a local copy of the repository.
